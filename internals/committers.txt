BDFLs
-----

Adrian and Jacob are the Co-`Benevolent Dictators for Life`_ of Django. When
"rough consensus and working code" fails, they're the ones who make the tough
decisions.

Core developers
---------------

These are the folks who have a long history of contributions, a solid track
record of being helpful on the mailing lists, and a proven desire to dedicate
serious time to Django. In return, they've been granted the coveted commit bit,
and have free rein to hack on all parts of Django.

`Malcolm Tredinnick`_
    Malcolm originally wanted to be a mathematician, somehow ended up a software
    developer. He's contributed to many Open Source projects, has served on the
    board of the GNOME foundation, and will kick your ass at chess.
        
    When he's not busy being an International Man of Mystery, Malcolm lives in
    Sydney, Australia.

Russell Keith-Magee
    Russell studied physics as an undergraduate, and studied neural networks for
    his PhD. His first job was with a startup in the defense industry developing
    simulation frameworks. Over time, mostly through work with Django, he's
    become more involved in web development.

    Russell has helped with several major aspects of Django, including a
    couple major internal refactorings, creation of the test system, and more.
    
    Russell lives in the most isolated capital city in the world — Perth,
    Australia.
    
Joseph Kocherhans
    Joseph is currently a developer at EveryBlock_, and previously worked for
    the Lawrence Journal-World where he built most of the backend for the their
    Marketplace site. He often disappears for several days into the woods,
    attempts to teach himself computational linguistics, and annoys his
    neighbors with his Charango_ playing.
    
    Joseph's first contribution to Django was a series of improvements to the
    authorization system leading up to support for pluggable authorization.
    Since then, he's worked on the new forms system, its use in the admin, and
    many other smaller improvements.
    
    Joseph lives in Chicago, USA.

    written a `book on Django`_, and enjoys fine port and talking to
